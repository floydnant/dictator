# Dictator

Push-to-talk dictation for macOS. Hold a key, talk, release — cleaned-up text lands in
whatever text field has focus. A Wispr Flow-shaped app, built native and fully on-device.

**Status:** working skeleton. Builds, launches, arms the hotkey, transcribes, injects.
The LLM cleanup tier is the next pass.

## Coexisting with another dictation app

This app is built to run alongside other dictation tools without colliding with them, which
is not automatic on macOS and is worth understanding before changing anything:

- **Bundle ID `com.floyd.dictator`** — TCC keys Accessibility and Microphone
  grants to the bundle ID, so granting or revoking a permission here has no effect on any
  other app, and vice versa.
- **Executable `Dictator`** — distinct enough that `pkill -x Dictator` cannot
  match a differently-named binary. The `Makefile` only ever targets `$(EXEC)`.
- **Hotkey is configurable** (Right ⌥ / fn / Right ⌘) precisely because another tool may
  already own the key you'd reach for first. The event tap inspects only its own keycode
  and passes everything else through untouched.

If you run more than one dictation app, give each a different push-to-talk key. Two apps on
the same key both record, and whichever injects text will fight the other.

---

## Quick start

```bash
make install     # builds, bundles, signs, copies to /Applications, launches
```

Then grant two permissions — neither is optional, and neither can be requested silently:

| Permission | Where | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Accessibility | The `CGEventTap` that sees the hotkey, the AX text insert, and the media-pause key |
| **Microphone** | Prompted on first dictation | Audio capture |

Restart Dictator after granting Accessibility. Then hold **Right ⌥** and talk.

### Why grants survive rebuilds here

TCC stores a *code-signing requirement* per entry, not just a path. An ad-hoc signature
changes on every build, so the rebuilt binary stops satisfying the stored requirement —
and the symptom is nasty: the Accessibility toggle still **shows as on** while the app is
reported untrusted, and flipping it changes nothing because the stale row is the problem.

The `Makefile` therefore signs with a stable Developer ID (auto-detected via
`security find-identity`, falling back to ad-hoc). Verified: rebuild + reinstall keeps both
grants with no re-prompt.

If a grant ever does get wedged, reset that one row and re-add — never toggle:

```bash
tccutil reset Accessibility com.floyd.dictator
tccutil reset Microphone   com.floyd.dictator
```

Always pass the bundle ID. A bare `tccutil reset Accessibility` wipes **every** app on the
machine. Then quit System Settings entirely (⌘Q) before reopening — that pane caches its
list and will otherwise show the row you just deleted.

> **Keep the build out of iCloud.** `~/Desktop` and `~/Documents` are file-provider synced
> on this machine; the sync engine can materialize/dematerialize files inside an `.app` and
> corrupt its signature. `make install` puts the running copy in `/Applications`.

Other targets: `make app` (bundle only), `make run` (run in place), `make clean`.

### Decisions worth knowing

**The HUD must never take focus.** `HUDPanel` is a `.nonactivatingPanel` with
`canBecomeKey == false`. This is the load-bearing detail of the whole app: if the overlay
took key status, the user's text field would lose focus and there'd be nothing left to
inject into. Everything else is replaceable; this isn't.

**The hotkey needs a `CGEventTap`, not `NSEvent`.** `fn` and left/right modifier
discrimination don't surface through `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` or the Carbon
hotkey API. A session event tap is the only way to see them — which is why Accessibility
permission is a hard requirement rather than a nicety.

**Audio ordering is explicit.** `AudioCapture` yields into an `AsyncStream` drained by a
single task. Spawning a `Task` per buffer would be simpler and would silently corrupt the
transcript, because unstructured tasks have no ordering guarantee.

**Buffers are copied, never borrowed.** `AVAudioEngine` recycles the buffer it hands to a
tap the instant the callback returns. `AudioChunk`'s `@unchecked Sendable` is only sound
because `AudioCapture` always allocates fresh storage before handing off.

**Media pausing is a toggle aimed at a moving target.** `MediaPause` posts the system
play/pause key, which reaches everything the media keys reach — including video in a browser
tab, which no scripting approach covers without an Automation prompt. But it is a *toggle*,
so sending it when nothing is playing starts music. `AudioActivity` is the guard: public
CoreAudio process objects say which apps have a live output stream, and nothing is sent
unless one does. `MediaRemote`, the obvious alternative, is private and entitlement-gated
since macOS 15.4.

**Two swappable seams.** `TranscriptionEngine` and `TextFormatter` are protocols so the
two components most likely to change can change without touching anything else.

## Speech engine

The engine is **Parakeet v3** via FluidAudio (CoreML on the Neural Engine) — best-in-class
English WER, ~110× realtime, ~66 MB resident, ~470 MB downloaded once on first use. It is
batch, not streaming: audio is accumulated while the key is held and transcribed in one
pass on release, so there is no live text in the HUD.

Apple's **`SpeechAnalyzer` / `SpeechTranscriber`** — no dependency, no bundled model, real
streaming — needs macOS 26 and is therefore not part of this build, which targets macOS 14.
`TranscriptionEngine` is the seam it plugs back into; nothing else has to change.

| | Apple SpeechTranscriber | Parakeet v3 (FluidAudio) | Whisper large-v3 (WhisperKit) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dependency | none | SwiftPM | SwiftPM |
| Model download | OS-managed | ~600 MB | ~1.5 GB |
| English accuracy | good | best | good |
| Languages | many | 25 | 99 |
| Latency | low | ~80 ms | 200–500 ms |

## Not built yet

1. **LLM cleanup tier.** `RuleBasedFormatter` strips fillers, fixes spacing, capitalizes
   sentences and adds terminal punctuation — genuinely useful, entirely deterministic. The
   real win is a second `TextFormatter` backed by Apple's on-device Foundation Models
   (macOS 26) for tone, list formatting, and honoring spoken corrections, with Claude as an
   optional higher-quality tier.
2. **Command Mode.** Select text, hold a second hotkey, say "make this more formal."
   Needs AX read of `kAXSelectedTextAttribute` plus an LLM round-trip.
3. **Personal dictionary.** Names and jargon the ASR keeps missing. `SpeechAnalyzer`
   supports this through `AnalysisContext` / `SFCustomLanguageModelData`.
4. **Branding.** `Brand` in `HUDView.swift` is a two-color placeholder gradient. App icon,
   real palette, HUD motion design, onboarding.
5. **Onboarding.** A first-run window that walks through both permissions instead of
   relying on the menu's "Grant…" items.
6. **Developer ID signing + notarization.** Ends the TCC-reset churn and makes the app
   distributable.

## Verified

Driven with a synthetic Right ⌥ hold (`scratchpad/ptt/ptt2.swift` posts `flagsChanged`
events) and confirmed via `/usr/bin/log show --predicate 'subsystem ==
"com.floyd.dictator"'`:

- Builds clean under Swift 6 strict concurrency.
- Signs with Developer ID; grants survive rebuild + reinstall.
- Launches as an accessory app, no Dock icon, menu bar item present.
- Event tap arms on grant without a restart (the poller catches it).
- Full state machine: `starting → listening → finishing → idle`, no errors.
- `SpeechAnalyzer` starts; models already installed, no download stall.
- Audio capture runs and converts native 48 kHz → 16 kHz for the engine.
- HUD renders bottom-center at `{{790, 96}, {340, 76}}` without taking focus.
- Silence produces an empty transcript and injects nothing.
- Media pausing, driven directly against Spotify: playing → paused on hold → playing again
  on release; a no-op when nothing is playing; and when the key reaches the wrong app, the
  stray playback is detected and undone in under a second.

**Not yet verified:** speech → transcript → cleanup → injection. Synthetic key events
can't produce audio, so this needs a human to hold the key and talk.

> `log` is shadowed in this shell — use `/usr/bin/log` explicitly or it returns nothing.
